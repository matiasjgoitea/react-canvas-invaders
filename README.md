# React Canvas Invaders

Space Invaders immitation implemented on Canvas primitives with React for game logic and game status.

React requires some initial setup before we can get our hands dirty.
To agilize this process i used `create-react-app`

You can do the same by running:


```sh
npx create-react-app project-name
cd project-name
npm start
```


NOTE: If you don't have npx (npm<5.2) you can install it globally by running:
```sh
  npm i -g npx
```

Or you can update node/NPM with `nvm` to a higher version, is up to you.


## Run Project


### NPM


```sh
npm i
npm start
```
